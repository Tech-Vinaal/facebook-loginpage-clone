I designed and built a Facebook login page clone using only HTML and CSS, demonstrating proficiency in front-end layout and responsive styling techniques.

## Overview

This project is a high-fidelity UI clone of the current Facebook login page, meticulously recreated using only standard web development languages: HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The goal was to accurately replicate the visual design, layout, and user experience of the authentic interface, serving as a robust demonstration of front-end skills, especially in complex layout management and pixel-perfect styling. 

## Key Features & Replication Highlights

- Pixel-Perfect Accuracy: All visual elementsâ€”including the distinctive Facebook blue and green color palette, font styles (such as Roboto or similar-looking sans-serif fonts), and the classic logo placementâ€”have been replicated to match the source material precisely.
- Form Structure: The central login form is structurally identical, including fields for email/phone and password, the main "Log In" button, the link, and the horizontal rule leading to the "Create New Account" button.
- Two-Column Layout: The core layout, which places the brand message/logo on one side and the login form on the other, is faithfully reproduced, demonstrating proficiency with modern CSS layout techniques (like Flexbox or Grid).
- Static Content: The project focuses purely on the presentation layer (HTML and CSS), successfully rendering the exact look and feel of the page without any back-end functionality or dynamic validation (i.e., it is a static clone).

## Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced CSS Styling: Mastery of selectors, pseudo-classes, and the Box Model to achieve precise visual parity.
- Complex Layout Management: Ability to recreate complex, multi-element page layouts using modern CSS techniques.
- Attention to Detail: The effort required for this clone highlights an acute attention to detail necessary for high-quality front-end work.
- This project stands as a concrete portfolio piece showcasing the ability to translate a real-world design into clean, maintainable, and accurate front-end code.
